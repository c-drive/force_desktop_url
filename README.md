# force_desktop_url
For Wikipedia: Force desktop URL on linked pages that go to mobile version of the site. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington

This is particularly annoying for desktop users with darkmode enabled because the mobile page does not conserve this setting. 
Many Wikipedia links found in the wild contain the mobile URL because many users post to Reddit, Twitter, etc. using mobile platforms.
